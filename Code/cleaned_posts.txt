95592, Short Question What is the proper way to install pip virtualenv and distribute ? Background In my answer to SO question 4314376 I recommended using ez_setup so that you could then install pip and virtualenv as follows  curl -O http   peak.telecommunity.com dist ez_setup.pysudo python ez_setup.pysudo easy_install pipsudo pip install virtualenv I originally pulled these instructions from Jesse Noller s blog post So you want to use Python on the Mac? . I like the idea of keeping a clean global site-packages directory so the only other packages I install there are virtualenvwrapper and distribute .  I recently added distribute to my toolbox because of this Python public service announcement . To install these two packages I used  sudo pip install virtualenvwrappercurl -O http   python-distribute.org distribute_setup.pysudo python distribute_setup.py No more setuptools and easy_install To really follow that Python public service announcement on a fresh Python install I would do the following  curl -O http   python-distribute.org distribute_setup.pysudo python distribute_setup.pysudo easy_install pipsudo pip install virtualenvsudo pip install virtualenvwrapper Glyph s Rebuke In a comment to my answer to SO question 4314376 SO user Glyph stated  NO. NEVER EVER do sudo python setup.py install whatever. Write a ~ .pydistutils.cfg that puts your pip installation into ~ .local or something. Especially files named ez_setup.py tend to suck down newer versions of things like setuptools and easy_install which can potentially break other things on your operating system. Back to the short question So Glyph s response leads me to my original question  What is the proper way to install pip virtualenv and distribute ? What s the proper way to install pip virtualenv and distribute for Python? python  virtualenv  setuptools  distribute

87234, Here is a piece of C   code that shows some very peculiar behavior. For some strange reason sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster  #include &lt algorithm&gt #include &lt ctime&gt #include &lt iostream&gt int main       Generate data const unsigned arraySize   32768  int data arraySize   for  unsigned c   0  c &lt  arraySize    c  data c    std  rand   % 256     !!! With this the next loop runs faster. std  sort data data   arraySize      Test clock_t start   clock    long long sum   0  for  unsigned i   0  i &lt  100000    i       Primary loop for  unsigned c   0  c &lt  arraySize    c    if  data c  &gt   128  sum    data c       double elapsedTime   static_cast&lt double&gt  clock   - start    CLOCKS_PER_SEC  std  cout &lt &lt  elapsedTime &lt &lt  std  endl  std  cout &lt &lt  &quot sum   &quot  &lt &lt  sum &lt &lt  std  endl   Without std  sort data data   arraySize   the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data the code runs in 1.93 seconds. Initially I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly so I tried Java  import java.util.Arrays import java.util.Random public class Main  public static void main String   args       Generate data int arraySize   32768  int data     new int arraySize   Random rnd   new Random 0   for  int c   0  c &lt  arraySize    c  data c    rnd.nextInt   % 256     !!! With this the next loop runs faster Arrays.sort data      Test long start   System.nanoTime    long sum   0  for  int i   0  i &lt  100000    i       Primary loop for  int c   0  c &lt  arraySize    c    if  data c  &gt   128  sum    data c       System.out.println  System.nanoTime   - start    1000000000.0   System.out.println &quot sum   &quot    sum      With a similar but less extreme result. My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache but then I thought how silly that was because the array was just generated. What is going on? Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms so the order should not matter. Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array? java  c++  performance  optimization  branch-prediction

When I do this from the link method  scope.$watch scope.model function    console.log   changed new val    scope.model     This is only called once when initalizing the directive and the value then is empty. When the value is retrieved via ajax  from $http.get   this watch function is not called again. However in other parts of the page where I m displaying   someField   that value DOES update when ajax request is fetched. So I don t think the problem has to do with doing $scope.apply   after ajax request. Edit  someField is assigned in the controller. Here is the code  MyApp.controller  myCtrl    $scope   $rootScope   $routeParams   ajax   $filter function $scope $rootScope $routeParams ajax $filter   var userId   parseInt  $routeParams.userId    $scope.loaded   false  $scope.someField         initalize with empty value var load   function data    $scope.loaded   true  $scope.someField   data.someField     ajax.getUser userId .success load        The method ajax.getUser   does a $http.get   and returns its promise . In the code above the load method is called which sets the value of someField . scope.$watch in a directive isn t being called after AJAX request javascript  angularjs

9951, I have to build an url dynamically according to the current url. Using the  % url %  tag is the easiest way to do it but I need the current url name to generate the new one dynamically. How can I get the url name attached to the urlconf that leads to the current view? EDIT   I know I can manually handcraft the url using get_absolute_url but I d rather avoid it since it s part of a lecture and I would like to demonstrate only one way to build urls. The students know how to use  % url %  . They are know facing a problem when they have to generate a more complete url based on the current one. The easiest way is to use  % url %  again with some variations. Since we have named url we need to know how to get the name of the url that called the current view. EDIT 2  another use case is to display parts of the base template différently according to the base template. There are other ways to do it  using CSS and  % block %  but sometime it just nice to be able to remove the tag of the menu entry of base.html if the viewname match the link.

However chrome doesn t seem to un-gzip these files and for the javascript files I get a lot of  illegal character  errors. If I view source I still see the files as compressed rather than uncompressed. My question is what should I set as the content type for these files in order for the browser to interpret them correctly as gzipped css   js files and un-gzip them?

But PrettyTime only returns its results as Date objects and I see no way to convert the Date objects into calendar objects.

95592, In HTML5 I know that &lt nav&gt  can be used either inside or outside the page s masthead &lt header&gt  element. For websites having both secondary and main navigation it seems common to include the secondary navigation as a &lt nav&gt  element inside the masthead &lt header&gt  element with the main navigation as a &lt nav&gt  element outside the masthead &lt header&gt  element. However if the website lacks secondary navigation it appears common to include the main navigation in a &lt nav&gt  element within the masthead &lt header&gt  element. If I follow these examples my content structure will be based on the inclusion or exclusion of secondary navigation. This introduces a coupling between the content and the style that feels unnecessary and unnatural. Is there a better way so that I m not moving the main navigation from inside to outside the masthead &lt header&gt  element based on the inclusion or exclusion of secondary navigation? Main and Secondary Navigation Example &lt header&gt  &lt nav&gt  &lt !-- Secondary Navigation inside &lt header&gt  --&gt  &lt ul&gt  &lt li&gt &lt  li&gt  &lt  ul&gt  &lt  nav&gt  &lt h1&gt Website Title&lt  h1&gt &lt  header&gt &lt nav&gt  &lt !-- Main Navigation outside &lt header&gt  --&gt  &lt ul&gt  &lt li&gt &lt  li&gt  &lt  ul&gt &lt  nav&gt  OnlineDegrees.org is an example site that follows the above pattern. Main Only Navigation Example &lt header&gt  &lt h1&gt Website Title&lt  h1&gt  &lt nav&gt  &lt !-- Main Navigation inside &lt header&gt  --&gt  &lt ul&gt  &lt li&gt &lt  li&gt  &lt  ul&gt  &lt  nav&gt &lt  header&gt  Keyzo.co.uk is an example site that follows the above pattern. Excerpts from Introducing HTML5 — Added on 02-Feb-11 7 38 AM Introducing HTML5 by Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp has this to say about the subject  The header can also contain navigation. This can be very useful for site-wide navigation especially on template-driven sites where the whole of the &lt header&gt  element could come from a template file. Of course it s not required that the &lt nav&gt  be in the &lt header&gt  . If depends largely on whether you believe the site-wide navigation belongs in the site-wide header and also pragmatic considerations about ease of styling. Based on that last sentence it appears that Bruce Lawson—author of the chapter those excerpts are from—admits that  pragmatic considerations about ease of styling  yield a coupling between the content and the style. In HTML5 should the main navigation be inside or outside the element? html
