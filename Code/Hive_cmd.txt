# 3. Using Hive and/or MapReduce, get:
### I. The top 10 posts by score
### II. The top 10 users by post score
### III. The number of distinct users, who used the word “Hadoop” in one of their posts

## Step 1: Create table
hive> create external table if not exists cleaningdata (no int, Id int, Score int, ViewCount int, Body string, OwnerUserId int, OwnerDisplayName string, Title string, Tags string)

    > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
hive> load data inpath 'hdfs://cluster-edd6-m/user/pig/cleaningdata.csv' into table cleaningdata;

## I. The top 10 posts by score

hive> SELECT * FROM cleaningdata ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 10;

hive> SELECT no,Id,TItle,Score FROM cleaningdata ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 10;


## II. The top 10 users by post score


hive> SELECT OwnerUserId, OwnerDisplayName, SUM(Score) AS total_score FROM cleaningdata GROUP BY OwnerUserId,OwnerDisplayName ORDER BY total_score DESC LIMIT 10;


## III. The number of distinct users, who used the word “Hadoop” in one of their posts

hive> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT OwnerUserId) FROM cleaningdata WHERE Title like '%hadoop%' or Body like '%hadoop%' or Tags like '%hadoop%';
