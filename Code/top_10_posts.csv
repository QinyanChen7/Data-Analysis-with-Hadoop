For websites having both secondary and main navigation it seems common to include the secondary navigation as a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element inside the masthead <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element with the main navigation as a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element outside the masthead <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element.  However if the website lacks secondary navigation it appears common to include the main navigation in a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element within the masthead <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element.</p><p>If I follow these examples my content structure will be based on the inclusion or exclusion of secondary navigation. This introduces a coupling between the content and the style that feels unnecessary and unnatural.</p><p>Is there a better way so that I'm not moving the main navigation from inside to outside the masthead <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element based on the inclusion or exclusion of secondary navigation?</p><h2>Main and Secondary Navigation Example</h2><pre><code>&lt;header&gt;    &lt;nav&gt;        &lt;!-- Secondary Navigation inside &lt;header&gt; --&gt;        &lt;ul&gt;            &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;/nav&gt;    &lt;h1&gt;Website Title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;nav&gt;    &lt;!-- Main Navigation outside &lt;header&gt; --&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;        &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre><p><a href="http://onlinedegrees.org">OnlineDegrees.org</a> is an example site that follows the above pattern.</p><p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jolBc.png" alt="enter image description here"></p><h2>Main Only Navigation Example</h2><pre><code>&lt;header&gt;    &lt;h1&gt;Website Title&lt;/h1&gt;    &lt;nav&gt;        &lt;!-- Main Navigation inside &lt;header&gt; --&gt;        &lt;ul&gt;            &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/header&gt;</code></pre><p><a href="http://keyzo.co.uk/">Keyzo.co.uk</a> is an example site that follows the above pattern.</p><p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0JD0t.png" alt="enter image description here"></p><h2>Excerpts from <em>Introducing HTML5</em> — Added on 02-Feb-11 7:38 AM</h2><p><a href="http://amzn.com/0321687299"><em>Introducing HTML5</em></a> by Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp has this to say about the subject:</p><blockquote>  <p>The header can also contain navigation.
